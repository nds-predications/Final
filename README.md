The goal of this project is to predict NBA game outcomes using a multiple linear regression machine learning model. Using game statistics from previous seasons, our model identifies which performance dimensions had been the most influencial factors, e.g. 3 pointers, free throws, etc... Once the model understands the relative importances of each variable during past games, it can predict the outcomes of future games by aggregating the metrics for each matchup and producing a forcasted point spread and a classification of "win" or "lose."
